# Forest Cover Types Prediction Project

## Overview
The Forest Cover Types Prediction project aims to classify forest cover types based on various environmental features. The dataset includes information about elevation, aspect, slope, distances to hydrology, roadways, and fire points, as well as wilderness areas and soil types. The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts the forest cover type.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

1. **Elevation**: Quantitative, representing the elevation in meters.
2. **Aspect**: Quantitative, measured in degrees azimuth.
3. **Slope**: Quantitative, measured in degrees.
4. **Horizontal Distance to Hydrology**: Quantitative, measured in meters.
5. **Vertical Distance to Hydrology**: Quantitative, measured in meters.
6. **Horizontal Distance to Roadways**: Quantitative, measured in meters.
7. **Horizontal Distance to Fire Points**: Quantitative, measured in meters.
8. **Wilderness Areas (wilderness_area1, wilderness_area2, wilderness_area3, wilderness_area4)**: Binary variables indicating the presence of specific wilderness areas.
9. **Soil Types (soil_type_1 to soil_type_40)**: Binary variables indicating the presence of specific soil types.
10. **Cover Type**: Categorical, representing the forest cover type (classes 1 to 7).

## Project Structure
1. `data/`: Contains the forest cover dataset (e.g., `forest_cover_data.csv`).
2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
3. `models/`: Trained classification models (e.g., `random_forest_model.pkl`).
4. `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Explore the data using the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Train a classification model (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) to predict forest cover types.
5. Evaluate the model's performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Usage
1. Load the forest cover dataset (`forest_cover_data.csv`) using the provided Python script.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, etc.).
3. Train a classification model using the processed data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.
5. Save the trained model for future predictions.
